# 3 items about me

1 - I love swimming
2 - I wanna travelling in the nearest future a lot of times
3 - I am currently traveling on a solid fragment of silicate rock and frozen H₂O particles, enveloped in a thin gaseous atmosphere protected by an ozone layer.

This fragment orbits a massive thermonuclear sphere — the Sun — where fusion reactions, primarily the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle, convert hydrogen into helium, releasing vast amounts of energy.

Guided by gravitational forces, our journey continues within the curved fabric of spacetime, spiraling through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way toward the gravitational center — the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*.
